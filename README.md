Jain Muni Locator
===============

This repository contains public code files for our website http://jainmunilocator.org


The initiative taken is about building a global database to locate all the Digambar Jain Muni-shris in world. The database is freely accessible to all the Jainism followers on this website. As time is eternal and formless, this initiative will help the modern jainism followers to be informed about Munishris just by an instant search which can be done on various smart phones.
Jain Muni Locator will expand and reach to Munishri's and Aryika's, who are bondless spiritual souls, will teach us the importance of being self- disciplined.
The initiative is to preserve the beliefs and practices of Jainism and this regularly updated website will help jain community to stay in touch with their religion in this trendy scenario.
Thus, advancing will establish oneself in moral values and will bring spiritual revolution.
